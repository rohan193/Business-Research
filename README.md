  - Banking is moving towards value delivery to customers beyond easier access to products considering the recent advance in digital banking
  - Incumbents continue to view digital as an opportunity to expand their customer lifetime value (CLTV), while fintechs obsess over niche customer needs
- [A Model to Determine Customer Lifetime Value in a Retail Banking Context](http://www.michaelhaenlein.eu/Publications/Haenlein,%20Michael%20-%20A%20model%20to%20determine%20customer%20lifetime%20value%20in%20a%20retail%20banking%20context.pdf)
  - The model is based on four different groups of profitability drivers: age, demographics/ lifestyle data, product ownership (type and intensity) and activity level
  - Factors affecting the customer value - age, share-of-wallet, household income and joint accounts, with age being the most important one
  - **Age** can be assumed to influence profitability by its impact on consumption patterns. For example middle-aged customers tend to be more profitable than younger ones because they tend to maintain higher balances and are more likely to have mortgages
  - **Demographics/Lifestyle**
